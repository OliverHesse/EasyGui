-Current Feature-
- add Textured combo Box
- add Scroll comboBox for both Textured and normal
- add Drop down menu(basically combo box but each val triggers a consumer)

things to work on
- add bezier curves
- convert as many BaseRenderable functions as possible to default
-update how labels are made
- override effect display
- make culling work with rotation:
    - region math and region checking works
    - cull region does not rotate so be careful with anything that involves culling
    - try implement my own cut shader
    - temporarily get it to support 0 90 180 270 rotation

-potentially move all positioning over to double for accuracy

bug fixes needed
- rotated view buggy. different gui scales change it
- clicking or dragging scrollbar can cause it to be permanently offset

-changes
- getGlobalX() now properly applies rotation and scaling
- change ScreenToLocal to work with new system
-make system work with rotations
    - replace getGlobalScaledX/Y with getGlobalX/Y
    - make getter and setter for positionTransform and transform

-bugs fixed
- isMouseOver does not account for rotated stack
- button click timer seems inconsistent
