- known bugs
    - dynamic scroll box calculates maxYOffset without accounting for box height
    - dynamic scroll box calculates maxYOffset using x
    - Positioning is broken with useMinecraftScaling = false


- ideas
    - add a max width for labels. so for centering it still uses current width, but wrapping uses maxWidth
